# Module 22: Virtual Class II Lesson Plan (2 hours)

## Overview

The goal of this session is to introduce students to the capstone project, their project groups, and give them time to start working on their project proposal.

Prior to the two hour class time starting, there will be 30 minutes of office hours.

In the first section of class, the project requirements will be introduced and students will be put into their project groups.

The remainder of class, the students will work in breakout rooms with their project groups to work on an initial project proposal for approval.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the session, learners will be able to do the following:

* Understand the capstone project requirements

* Create a project proposal for approval

## Instructor Do: Office Hours (30 min)

Welcome to Office Hours! Remind the students that this is their time to ask questions and get assistance from their instructional staff as they’re learning new concepts and working on the challenge assignment. Feel free to use breakout rooms to create spaces focused on specific topics, or to have 1:1s with students.
Expect that students may ask for assistance such as the following:

* Challenge assignment
* Further review on a particular subject
* Debugging assistance
* Help with computer issues
* Guidance with a particular tool

Finally, remind students of the following:

* **Get professional**: Remind students that projects are their portfolio pieces so they should use project week as an opportunity to push themselves and showcase their knowledge. Tell them to keep their MVP simple and add features as they go to avoid [feature creep](https://uxdesign.cc/features-creepers-the-customer-experience-horror-story-124c8fa73edf).

* **Project metrics**:  Make sure students understand that their projects will be evaluated on their concept, design, functionality, collaboration, and presentation.

Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Do: Project Groups and Reminders (5 mins)

* Tell students that the remaining class time will be spent working in groups on their projects and announce the project groups.

* Remind students about the office hours schedule for the week.

* Tell students that meeting with your group and communicating regularly is imperative for successfully executing an online group project. They should plan for significant collaboration time outside of your virtual classes. Since this is their third project, they should utilize best practices from their previous two projects.

### 4. Students Do: Project Work Time (95 mins)

* Divide students into breakout rooms based on their project groups. You and the TAs should rotate through each breakout room to provide support and give a final sign-off on the project proposals. Every group should leave class today with an approved proposal.
